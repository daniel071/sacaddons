# How replays saved by the plugin are named

# Default: %player_name%-%timestamp%-%check-that-triggered%
# e.g. Notch-71023-SemiPrediction
# User: Notch, Timestamp: 10:23 on the 7th, Check: Semi Prediction
# Easier to sort by users when searching through replays

# Variation: %timestamp%-%player_name%-%check-that-triggered%
# e.g. 71023-Notch-SemiPrediction
# Timestamp: 10:23 on the 7th, User: Notch, Check: Semi Prediction
# Easier to sort by time occurred when searching through replays
replayhooknaming: "%player_name%-%timestamp%-%check-that-triggered%"

# Specify custom text for in-game messages.
# You can use colour codes from https://htmlcolorcodes.com/minecraft-color-codes/
# Place ${player} where you want the player name to be
# Place ${replay} where you want name of replay to be
